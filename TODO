1.	Basic NetFPGA driver for FreeBSD (host mode)
	- NetFPGA visible at FreeBSD address space
	- Ability to read and write registers
	- Linux command line tools ports / reimplemented
1.1	Be able to program binaries from FreeBSD.
2.	NetFPGA visible as(reference 4-Gbit Ethernet card in FreeBSD:
2.1	Data goes through PCI (less important)
2.2	Data goes through SATA (more important and may turn to be
