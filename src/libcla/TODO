- cla_dispatch should only take three arguments:
  cla_dispatch(cla, argc, argv)

- cla_lookup() should be smart enough to return only last command
  matching.

- cla_new should probably leave function argument untouched. This way,
  it would take one less argument. cla_set_func_arg should probably
  be named cla_set_softc() and should work recursively for all commands
  placed in the tree.

- cla_new should guarantee availability of specific number of arguments
  for the function associated with cla. This should be accomplished through
  "opts" argument.
